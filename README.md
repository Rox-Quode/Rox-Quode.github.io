# Basic JS portfolio

## This is my mini portfolio dedicated to JavaScript projects

**Background:**

In the web dev bootcamp I took, I've learned use jQuery to add interactivity to my websites. However I wanted to learn vanilla Javascript so I can understand it's concepts and utility. What I did was to find courses or tutorials that were building projects of intrest to me while explaing JS. 
It's an ongoing process and I hope to become fluent in JS. 

**Projects Summary**

Here I have coded a [sports scorecard](https://rox-quode.github.io/basketball-scorecard), a [unit converter](https://rox-quode.github.io/unit-converter) and a [password generator](https://rox-quode.github.io/password-generator). The latter is something that I actually use quite frequently and I've later added a RESET button. On this occasion, I took the opportunity to learn more about combinations and permutations (Math was never my strength).

I've hosted these [projects] (https://rox-quode.github.io/) on GitHub Pages.

You may also want to check out this [leads chrome extension](https://github.com/Rox-Quode/leads_chrome_extension) that I coded following a Scrimba beginner JS course.
